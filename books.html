                        Sometimes, closed pages speak up everything that even an alive man couldn't. <br><br>

                        A not so good-looking nerd was happily making castles in his own world... 
                        When suddenly life proposes him for a journey.
                        But what actually the journey had in store for Aditya- an ordeal or a bon voyage? <br><br>

                        In his journey Aditya encounters Anjali-a highly ambitious girl who treats life and relations very practically ; 
                        Sahil-a gem of a friend; Diya- an antidote to Aditya’s every damn problem; Ratna Ma’am- Aditya’s mentor who held him intact when the winds were rough.
                        What all shades of emotions do they paint on Aditya’s pious canvas of life? <br><br>

                        There is love to fight for; there is friendship to live for; there is betrayal to bear; there is loneliness to tear you apart into numerous pieces; 
                        there is life to survive; there is death to accept and there is GOD to compose a story. <br><br>

                        Does GOD’s choice of characters in Aditya’s life really in sync with what Aditya has thought for himself? 
                        Or does God has a better plan for him? Or maybe the worst one to punish him? <br><br>

                        No! It’s not just an ordinary story ... It’s a heart transformational story. It’s not always about the heart and the heartbreaks, sometimes it’s about Heart Transformation!
                        Give an ear to Aditya’s diary and it would speak up everything to you.
                        But BEWARE! Of the flood of emotions that may brim up your heart.

                        Crumpled Voices - Shades of Suffering is an anthology based on social issues.
                        <br><br>
                        A common thread of the prevailing societal evils and injustice binds them together. 
                        We have tried to weave stories ranging from rape to acid attack and domestic violence to honor killing in this anthology. 
                        All of us have witnessed such incidents in our day to day life, our near and dear ones might have experienced them closely too. 
                        We have almost grown up among them, felt them following us. 
                        We constantly live in fear of the unknown, fear of being the victim to any of the criminal activities multiplying around us. 
                        These days when no place is safe, including the web, our voices need to be heard. 
                        Protest must begin from somewhere, and we have used our pen which is mightier than the sword to express our anguish.
                        An echo of many unimaginable atrocities lurks within us, engulfing us in its shadow. 
                       Through each of the story in this book, we have tried to highlight one such aspect of horrifying crimes.

                        Crumpled Voices 2 - Innocence Lost is an anthology based on child abuse.
                        <br><br>
                        What happens when a protector turns into a predator? 
                        <br><br>
                        The issue of child abuse has always been a clandestine topic. 
                        The offenders are usually someone that the child trusts and looks upto, often someone within or close to the family.
                        Violating a child's trust can leave an idelible mark on their psyche. 
                        This book makes a successful attempt in helping the people realize the pain that they are inflicting upon children, 
                        be it mentally, physically, emotionally, socially or psychologically.
                        <br><br>
                        Children are the precious gift from the God entrusted to humans To love and to care for, not to be abused or neglected.

                        Crumpled Voices 4 - Strangled Emotions is an anthology based on social stigma. <br><br>

                        The fourth book in the series thrives to give a voice to all the strangled emotions that gradually died their natural death. 
                        Each author has tried to take up a different situation and expose the hidden suffering. 
                        We are doing our bit and I hope you all are able to do something too, to make your own difference. 
                        These humanitarian authors have tried their best to throw light on some of the brutal realities and unthinkable torture that we often tend to ignore; emotions that we feel but get used to and not do anything about. 
                        Read the stories and poems in Crumpled Voices 4 – Strangled Emotions and reflect on them. 
                        And don’t just put the book down, do something for a better tomorrow! 
                        Imagine, if we all did a little bit, the world can change! 
                        Let your voice be heard. 
                        Heal the wounds with love.
